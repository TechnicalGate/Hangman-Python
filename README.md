wordslist.txt is a list of all the words without spaces from Merriam Webster dictionary, created by wordslistgetter.py scraping the site for words.

To change the text that shows up when you get a letter wrong, you can edit themanhimself.txt, without editing the $ and numbers.

themanhimself.txt contains the ASCII art displayed when letters are incorrectly guessed. If you wish to edit the ASCII art, do not remove the $ or the numbers (e.g $0), as that is how the program seperates each art.
